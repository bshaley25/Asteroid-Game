# Asteriods!!!

This is my take on the classic Asteriods game!
The controls are as follows:
-Left and right arrow rotate counterClockwise and clockwise respectivly
-Up arrow accelerates to a limit
-Down arrow deccelerates(soft brake)
-Spacebar fires laser.

Those are the basic rules, now see if you can play to get a high score!
